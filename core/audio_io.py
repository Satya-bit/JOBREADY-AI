# This file is responsible for handling audio input/output operations,
# including text-to-speech, audio recording, and transcription.

# For audio generation this uses elevenlabs API and for transcription it uses SpeechRecognition 
# library with Google Web Speech API.

# Still the speech recognition(transcription) is not perfect using Google Web Speech API 
# and can fail in some cases. But can be improved by using better audio quality.
